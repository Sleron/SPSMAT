# SPSMAT
SPSMAT is an Octave/Matlab package to apply Spectral and Pseudospectral methods for solving ODEs and PDEs.
There is a worthy Guidance in ./SPSMATDocumentation.pdf file. To learn how to work with this package read this file first. 


This package is written in GNU Octave (Open source Matlab). See [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

All [Linux](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_GNU/Linux), [Mac](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_macOS), and [Windows](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Microsoft_Windows) users can download and use Octave.

For using the SPSMAT package you need to download and install [git](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03).
Then you can have a copy of SPSMAT on your system by running a command on your terminal or cmd:
>> git clone  https://github.com/siaadfilml/SPSMAT.git

Now you have the latest version of SPSMAT. 

In some systems, as the last step, open Octave and type in >> setenv PYTHON python3

Enjoy!
